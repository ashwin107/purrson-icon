# purrson-icon

Ever had problems making an icon to represent "a user"?
Don't know if you want a silhouette of a woman or a man?
And what about hairstyles? And beards? And clothing?

We feel your pain, and that's why we created the _purrson_ icon.
Let's establish a new standard icon for "user"â€”one that's
culturally accepted in any situation, everywhere.

(Yes, it's a cat. That's not weirder than a floppy disk for "save", is it?)

Feel free to use, remix and create variations of it.

Enjoy!
